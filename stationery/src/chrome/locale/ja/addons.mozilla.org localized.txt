#Summary
Extension to mimic Outlook Express Stationery. Allow you to use HTML files as templates for mail. Also allow custom template in replies or forwarded mail!

#Description
Simply use drop-down menu from buttons Write, Reply and Forward, and select "Other Stationery...".

As template you may use template files from MS Outlook Express. Or you may write one.

By default, last used template become default one. It incorporates idea: Last time used template is probably most liked one. It make all templates sorted, most recently used going on top.

But You can change default behavior: simply go to Tools / Stationery options, tab Options, and un-check "Manage templates automatically" setting. From now, Stationery will not update your list of templates, so default one will stay default until you change it manually in Stationery options.
