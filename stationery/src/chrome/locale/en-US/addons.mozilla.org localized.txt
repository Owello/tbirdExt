As template you may use template files from MS Outlook Express. Or you may write one.

By default, last used template become default one. It incorporates idea: Last time used template is probably most liked one. It make all templates sorted, most recently used going on top.

But You can change default behavior: simply go to <strong>Tools</strong> / <strong>Stationery options</strong>, tab <strong>Options</strong>, and un-check <strong>Enable automatic templates management</strong> checkbox. From now, <strong>Stationery</strong> will not update your list of templates, so default one will stay defaut until you change it manually in <strong>Stationery options</strong>.

Stationery now also works in cooperation with the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/324497/">SmartTemplate4</a> Add-on, to provide an even richer and better experience. SmartTemplate4 allows you to customize your templates beyond just design, by inserting information from the mail header.
