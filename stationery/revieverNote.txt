Stationery uses Gradle build system.
Sources are available at https://github.com/arivald/tbirdExt
To build XPI you have to checkout soures, then just enter the /stationery directory, then type `gradlew build` to build XPI. Built XPI will land in /stationery/build directory.
Working Java JRE is required for Gradle.

Stationery uses the Ace editor, https://ace.c9.io/, https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace.
Current version of Stationery uses the 1.2.8 version of Ace, direct link: https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds/archive/v1.2.8.zip. The JavaScript files are already minified, I choose the "src-min-noconflict" version.
The "buildAce" build task will download Ace, then it copy small subset of required files from the /src-min-noconflict into /stationery/src/chrome/content/ace directory, modifying the ace.js on the fly. The modification is to allow custom folds, feature that I require to fold images data: URLs. You can clearly see what is added, I put ↓↓↓ over added fragment.
There is no change in this matter since last version (except added ↓↓↓).
